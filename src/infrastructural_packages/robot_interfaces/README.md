# Robot Interfaces Package

## Description
This Package houses all of the custom message, service, and action types used by the rest of the code.

## Known Limitations
Not all of the custom types (and the URDF folder as a whole) are used, some are legacy, and some are from projects and ideas that didn't pan out. If you want to know what type was used for a specific purpose, it would be better to look at the import statements of the file rather than sift through all these.
